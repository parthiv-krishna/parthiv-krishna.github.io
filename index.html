                    <h1>Hi there! I'm Parthiv.</h1>
                    <p> I'm a student at Stanford with a passion for robotics and aspirations to pursue a career in
                        product innovation and entrepreneurship.
                        I have experience with various terrestrial and aerial robotics projects and have a particular
                        interest in controls, sensing, and parallelization.
                        As an Electrical Engineering major on the Hardware and Software track, I am excited to learn
                        more about signal processing and machine learning on edge computing devices!
                        I'm also minoring in Music, focusing on sound production and music theory. </p>

                                <p>During the final two years of high school, I worked on an independent research project that involved the
                                development of an autonomous drone to generate high-quality 3D maps in GPS-denied environments. As part of
                                the project, I developed, proposed, and presented the hardware and software needed to make the ~2kg 
                                autonomous drone a reality. I had the opportunity to attend events like the International Science and
                                Engineering Fair (ISEF) in 2018 and 2019 where I received the 4th Grand Award (<a href="pdf/ISEF 2019 Poster.pdf" target="_new">ISEF Poster</a>). 
                                I was also named a Regeneron STS Scholar (top 300 in the US) for my work on this project (<a href="pdf/Robust Autonomous MAV Navigation.pdf" target="_new">Paper</a>). 
                                </p>
                                <p>From a technical perspective, the project involved integrating sensors like cameras, IMUs, ultrasonic 
                                rangefinders, and LIDAR, to develop a robust SLAM system that could handle various environments and lighting
                                conditions. Compute was handled primarily by an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 using ROS for inter-process communication
                                between different nodes written in Python.
                                </p>
                                <p>Based on feedback from judges during the science fairs that I attended, I filed a patent on aspects of 
                                mapping technology. This patent was granted by the USPTO, #11,127,202! (<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US11127202B2" target="_new">Google Patents Link</a>, 
                                <a href="https://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=11127202.PN.&OS=PN/11127202&RS=PN/11127202" target="_new">USPTO Link</a>).
                                More recently, while in college, I have been working on commercializing the technology. I have conducted customer
                                interviews to discuss industrial use cases and began optimizing the system for some applications that I have
                                learned about.

                            and button input, using Verilog. Features that we implemented included:
                            </p>
                            <ul>

                            <p>Through the project, we gained a deeper understanding for aspects of digital design like combinational

                                <p> I am leading the design and development of Hopper, a small wheeled biped. As a project within the Extreme Mobility team of Stanford Robotics,
                                    we hope to benchmark various control algorithms. This project has been primarily remote, so progress has been somewhat slow, but we have done
                                    a lot of design and preliminary software work via physics simulation.
                                </p>
                                <p> Additionally, as part of the course CS 229: Machine Learning, I worked on implementing reinforcement learning-based control for Hopper. 
                                    Specifically, I developed a physics simulator using PyBullet, then trained two RL algorithms to control the robot in various scenarios, including
                                    stable balancing, velocity control, and jumping onto a step.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>DDPG: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient. DDPG consists of a critic network and actor network. A copy of both networks are 
                                            employed to calculate target values, and their weights are updated to slowly track those of the learned networks in order to increase stability.</li>
                                        <li>SAC: Soft Actor-Critic. SAC also uses an actor network and a critic network, as the name suggests. In contrast to the deterministic actions selected by 
                                            DDPG, SAC selects actions probabilistically. The goal of this algorithm is to maximize not only the reward but also the entropy of the policy in order to encourage exploration.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    We compared the results of the RL-based controllers to an LQR-based controller that my project partner developed, and found pretty positive results.
                                    In addition, we found that both DDPG and SAC succeeded in learning policies that controller Hopper to jump onto a small box, which would be more or
                                    less impossible to do with an optimal controller like LQR since Hopper loses contact/traction with the ground. 
                                </p>

                        <h1>CS 107e</h1>
                        <div class="columns is-multiline is-vcentered">
                            <div class="column is-two-thirds">
                                <p> As a student in CS 107e: Computer Systems from the Ground Up, I implemented various aspects of a computer system on a Raspberry Pi.
                                    The code was all written in bare metal C with no operating system. The aspects that I directly worked on were:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>A Larson Scanner, purely in ARM assembly!</li>
                                        <li>A clock, and a complete GPIO interfaced with the appropriate RasPi registers to enable digital reads/writes.</li>
                                        <li>A string library (<code>strcmp</code>, <code>strlcat</code>, <code>printf</code>, etc).</li>
                                        <li>A memory allocation library (<code>malloc</code>, <code>free</code>, <code>realloc</code>, etc).</li>
                                        <li>A PS/2 keyboard library and console with simple commands like <code>poke</code>, <code>peek</code>, <code>echo</code>, etc.</li>
                                        <li>A graphics library with text and shape (rectangles, anti-aliased lines, anti-aliased triangles, etc) drawing functionality.</li>
                                        <li>An interrupt handling library, to make the PS/2 keyboard more responsive when combined with costly graphics operations.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    By the end of the quarter, I had created a terminal. After plugging in an HDMI monitor and PS/2 keyboard to the Raspberry Pi,
                                    I could type on the keyboard, see the characters show up on the monitor, and execute simple commands, like changing the values in a GPIO register to turn on an LED.
                                    Additionally, my version of the console terminal had a "history" capability where you could click the up and down arrow keys to access recent commands.
                                    Though I cannot publish code publicly for honor code reasons, I am happy to discuss the class and projects -- see the Contact tab above. 
                                </p>
                                <p> As part of the course, I worked on an open ended final project called <i>Air Snare</i>, which is a drum kit you can play without drums. The hardware was two "drum sticks" (pencils)
                                    with LSM6DS33 IMUs and push buttons, the Raspberry Pi, and an HDMI monitor for sound output. One stick played a kick drum or snare drum (selected with the push button), and the other
                                    played a hi-hat or crash symbol. From a software standpoint, the project involved:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Development of I2C driver for two LSM6DS33 IMUs to read raw data.</li>
                                        <li>Filtering and gesture extraction from the IMU data.</li>
                                        <li>Audio sequencing to queue sounds to be played based on the detected gestures.</li>
                                        <li>Delivery of audio samples to the Raspberry Pi GPU to output over HDMI to the attached screen.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    All of this was implemented in bare-metal C with no operating system and no <code>stdlib</code>. However, I made use of the libraries I had written (mentioned above). 
                                    The code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/parthiv-krishna/cs107e-air-snare" target="_blank">this GitHub repository</a>, and some images and a video demo are below.
